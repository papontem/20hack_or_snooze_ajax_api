# 20hack_or_snooze_ajax_api

This is a public repo of the Hack or Snooze Project that i was tasked with completing some new features and adding neccessary logic to some of the starter code that I was provided.

## Project Description

🔥 If the name alone piqued your curiosity, you're absolutely correct in guessing that it's related to the Ycombinator HackerNews platform.

🚀 In this project, we explored an API and a webpage made for this course, aiming to replicate the marvelous HN website. I'm on the fence on whether i should add more css styling to it or leave it as the original intended copy style.

🌟 Give the original HackerNews a try and then prepare to be amazed by my version. I haven't found any disgusting bugs on it yet, do let me know of any you find. You'll probably notice a difference in the number of comments between my code and the code I was provided as a base! 😄

## ToDo:

    **following is a list of ideas id like to implement in the future.**

- [ ] Add some error handling for when a username has already been taken or if credentials are incorrect!
- [ ] Allow users to edit stories they have created.
- [ ] Add a section for a “user profile” where a user can change their name and password in their profile.
- [ ] Add Intuitive icons for navigation and manipulating users stories, and favoriting stories.
- [ ] Style the application so that it is presentable on mobile devices.
      1.possibly with dynamic width adjustments using a clamp from css?
- [ ] Add infinite scroll! When a user scrolls to the bottom of the page, load more stories.
- [ ] Come up with some other features you can build using what our Hack or Snooze API makes available to you!
