# 20hack_or_snooze_ajax_api

This is a public repo of the Hack or Snooze Project that i was tasked with completing some new features and adding neccessary logic to some of the starter code that I was provided.

## Project Description

üî• If the name alone piqued your curiosity, you're absolutely correct in guessing that it's related to the Ycombinator HackerNews platform.

üöÄ In this project, we explored an API and a webpage made for this course, aiming to replicate the marvelous HN website. I'm on the fence on whether i should add more css styling to it or leave it as the original intended copy style.

üåü Give the original HackerNews a try and then prepare to be amazed by my version. I haven't found any disgusting bugs on it yet, do let me know of any you find. You'll probably notice a difference in the number of comments between my code and the code I was provided as a base! üòÑ
